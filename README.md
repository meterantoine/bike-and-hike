## Description

In this project the goal was to make a simple business app where customers could interact with the business. I made it easier for customers to find relative information about the services that are available to them. Easier froms of communication and access to the different locations depending on where they live.

It uses Core Data to store all of the different services that the business provides. 

MapKit is used to show the user where the stores are located and by using maps it can all so give them directions to the store they prefer.



#### Technologies

- Core Data
- Mapkit
